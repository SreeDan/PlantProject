# Plant Project

This was my 10th grade science fair experiment. It attempts to use weather rainfall data from the [darksky API](https://darksky.net/dev) 
to determine the amount of water to give a plant each day.

This project was created using a peristaltic pump, raspberry pi, AC to DC adapter, and a 5v relay.
